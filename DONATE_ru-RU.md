CP Editor is free software, but we are not offering free labor. We are offering you [the freedom to use CP Editor](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). So your donation contributes a lot: It can help us spend more time on maintaining CP Editor, and we also need money to buy the cpeditor.org domain.
